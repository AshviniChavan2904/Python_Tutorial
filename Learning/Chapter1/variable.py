#When there is a condition where we need to store the a value then we use variable
name = "Ashvini"
age = 26
print(name)

# variable rules
# can't start a variable with number
# can't use special symbols in variable name except _ and -
# follow naming convension i.e., snake case writing e.g., user_name or camel case writing e.g., userName. Recommended is snake case writing
# normally python uses snake case and for java we use camel case writing
