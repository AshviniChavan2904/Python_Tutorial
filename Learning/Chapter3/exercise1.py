# Number guessing game
# Make a variable like win_num and assign any value to it
# Ask your to guess a number
# if user guess it correctly print you win!
# if user did not guess correctly then:
#   if user guess a number lower than win_num print too low
#   if user guess a number higher than win_num print too high
#Bonus: google how to generate random number in python
